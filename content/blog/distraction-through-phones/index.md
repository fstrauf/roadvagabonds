Wherever you look, you see people staring at there phones. While walking, sitting in the bus, in the car, on a bench in front of a beautiful beach, just everywhere.<!-- end --> 

What goes beyond my understanding though, is when you are having a conversation with someone, and all of a sudden a notification pops up on their display and instead of ignoring it, they pick up their phone and start answering - absolutely out of control! Often this happens in the office where people come up to me, interrupt my work and then,a minute into our talk, start reading emails. How did we get here?

# Why are smartphonees / technology doing this to our brains?

The Tim Ferriss show made me aware of Tristan Harris in this [episopde](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?i=1000450386427). Tristan, a design ethicist and founder of the [Center for Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com/), is one of the pioneers fighting not only smartphone but the addiction to technology in general. A quote often cited by him is:

> "The real problem of humanity is the following: <br>
> we have paleolithic emotions; <br>
> medieval institutions; <br>
> and god-like technology" <br>
> <br>
> E. O. Wilson

In his intro to the Center for Humane Technology, he goes on to explain what the actual price of free social media and other free apps is:

> free social isolation - meaning we don't need to get out and talk to people anymore
> free downgrading of attention spans - through the massive distraction these apps bring

While he is correct with what he is saying, I am not convinced his speeches and his design models will get the big corporations to correct course, after all it's their businessmodel to keep us addicted. So I guess it's up to us.

# Raising ones awareness

If the above hasn't helped you, maybe some statistics will. Deloitte has released a [study](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/technology-media-and-telecommunications/articles/global-mobile-consumer-survey-us-edition.html) that brings up some interesting observations.

* on average we look at our phones 52 times / day
* even brief mental blocks created by shifting between tasks can cost as much as 40% of your productive time. [link](https://www.apa.org/research/action/multitask)
* [Three quarters of people check their phone first thing when they wake up](https://www.success.com/12-steps-to-breaking-smartphone-addiction).
* "Brain Drain: The Mere Presence of Oneâ€™s Own Smartphone Reduces Available Cognitive Capacity" - [link](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/691462)

Most of us go through this day by day without even noticing and if that doesn't bother you that's absolutely fine, for me this was a definite sign to reduce my usage. If you look at it, it's habits again (details in my other [post](my-daily-routines-an-how-they-helped-me)) - there are certain triggers that invoke a routine and a reward waiting at the end (two new likes on Instagram!). Here is what I tried so far.

# Practical things you can do

A good list can be found [here](https://humanetech.com/resources/take-control/)

**screentime for social to 10min daily** This does help and even if you can get around it by just entering your pin, it does make you aware of how much time has passed.

**turn off notifications** This is the thing I constantly see with people; they see a message on their lockscreen and without even knowing, they are taken out of the present moment and often dive into whatever popped up in a seemingly auto pilot mode.

I only have calender reminders, so I don't miss appointments. This also works for your computer / mac. It's amazing how much one can focus by not having little popups distract you and urge you to reply as fast as you can.

**remove badges from apps** Have you ever wondered why these little badges are red (little circles in the upper right corner of every app that indicate what you've missed)? It immediately raises attention to new emails, likes etc. Check your notification settings to disable them.

**turn off vibration** Mine only vibrates on calender reminders 10/15 min previous to an event.

**greyscale** Simply removes the colors and makes your phone a [little less enticing](https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/grayscale-iphone-266894), so that mindlessly scrolling through social media becomes a little less interesting.

**no games** To me, there are better ways to kill time. Read, run, talk to someone etc.

**check your stats in screentime** [This great feature](https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT208982) allows you to look into how much time you spent on what, how often you pick up your phone and set limits. You can even do this for your kids.

**bedtime mode** Set this up on your iPhone to block notifications during sleep time - it is quite similar to the do not disturb mode.

**screen free sunday** A friend recently recommended this; A day without using any screen. Give it a try, it's not that hard and proves, you can survive without Instagram.

**leave your phone out of reach** Simple but effective. For me my pickup rate increases if my phone is just next to me - if I really want to focus, I'll just put it in a different room.

**build / change routines** In the morning, I only dive into social media after my workout, meditation and journaling.

**eradicate your newsfeeed** [The News Feed Eradicator for Facebook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg) replaces your browser Facebook-Feed with a nice quote. You can deactivate this plugin in emergencies, but it's an additional step before you start mindlessly scrolling.

Cal Newport, in his book [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/) goes even further and describes a fully fledges approach called the **Digital Declutter** to reduce your addiction to phones. If you've read this far, I can absolutely recommend his book.

# Why would you do all this?

**more time** By applying this, I feel I have more time to spend on other stuff (reading, enjoying the summer, surfing or just getting things done that need to be done or I am passionate about).

**better sleep** In his book [Why we Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_We_Sleep), Matthew Walker talks about the damage, blue light emitted by our phones, does to our sleep, so less blue light = better sleep.

**stop the FOMO** the fear of missing out keeps you attached to social media updates and causes anxiety. You will be better off [without it](https://www.developgoodhabits.com/fear-of-missing-out/).

**better relationships** not staring at your phone when having dinner with your partner will get you talking, understanding and ultimately improve your relationship. Give people you care about your full attention. Just think about how stupid you feal when you're in a conversation with someone and he just answers a call or reads through an email?

**increase your attention span** [your attention span might get better than that of a goldfish again](https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/)

**solitude** I found this idea in [Digital Minimalism](https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/). According to Cal Newport, people who are tied to their phones suffer a deprivation of solitude.

> A state in which you spend close to zero time alone with your own thoughts and free from input from other minds.

Why would we want solitude? Well I guess it helps you process your emotions, reflect on thoughts and digest things that really matter without the constant input. He suggest simply going for a walk without earbuds, instagram or music - just leave it all at home.
