Although being mostly City, Singapore still has a bunch outdoor activities on offer.<!-- end -->

## Botanical Garden

With plenty of space to relax on the grass and have a picnic, the botanical garden of Singapore is a great location for a nice and sunny day. Lot’s of beautiful plants and flowers and different theme gardens to explore. Singapore Botanical Garden is the first and only tropical Botanical Garden on theUNESCO's World Heritage list.

## Mount Faber Park, Henderson Waves

A nice track through the greens - multiple tracks lead up to the top and if you prefer not to be all sweaty, you can take a bus. There’s a bunch of viewpoints at Mount Faber Park and a cable car will take you  to Sentosa Island after having a cold drink on the top. If you’re up for a longer walk, you can go all the way along the southern ridges (a 10 km stretch of green open spaces in Singapore) to Alexandra. On the way there you’ll pass by The Henderson Waves, an interesting wooden floor bridge and the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore. The Henderson Waves connect Mount Faber Park with the Telok Blangah Hill Park, which is also part of the southern ridges. The southern ridges, continues with a canopy walk through the forest.

## MacRitchie Reservoir

For a little jungle experience in Singapore the MacRitchie reservoir is the right place to go - it is Singapore's oldest reservoir and is located in the north, surrounded by forest. You’ll get there by bus and can choose a trail - the longest is around 11 km and will include the Tree Top Walk (check the opening hours [here](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/gardens-parks-and-nature/parks-and-nature-reserves/central-catchment-nature-reserve/treetop-walk)).

The trails are quite nice and lead around the reservoir and into the 'jungle'. If you’re not into hiking, paddling on the lake is another fun option around here. The highlight though, is the Tree Top walk which is a big suspension bridge spanning over the forest where you might see some monkeys.

If 11 km still isn’t enough, you can move on to Bukit Timah for more trails or walk along the old railroad corridor nearby. This is an abandoned [railway track](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/railcorridor) leading from south to north Singapore and is about 24 km long.

## Labrador Park, Keppel Bay, Prive Cafe

Located at the west coast of Singapore, Labrador Park is a part of the southern ridges. A good starting point is the Labrador MRT station. From here, different trails bring you to the Bukit Chermin Boardwalk, a walk across the southern waterfront with a good view on the rocky cliffs of Sentosa Island.

The Boardwalk ends at the 'Reflections at Keppel Bay', luxury residencies designed by Daniel Libeskind. The architecture and the boats in the harbor are worth seeing. From here just walk along the promenade. At the end of the Keppel Bay Drive you can have a casual lunch/dinner or enjoy a coffee and really good cake on the terrace of the [Privé Keppel Bay](http://theprivegroup.com.sg/prive-keppel-bay.html) with holiday feeling harbor view.

## East Coast Park

Beach, playgrounds and restaurants means there is a lot to do at the East Coast Park. It’s not the typical lonely, idyllic tropical beach you see in Thailand or Indonesia, but there is a long beach, palm trees and a nice walk. You’ll see thousands of ships pass by every day from here on their way from China to Europe. So if you want to escape the city for a bit and Sentosa is too much for you, then it sure is enjoyable.

## Marina Barrage

Take the MRT to Marina South and walk through the Gardens by the Bay. After reaching the Marina Barrage walk across the barrage to take the long walk along this side of the marina bay. The Barrage is another reservoir keeping out seawater to over time create a big freshwater reservoir. On this side there’s only few people, the park is really nice and you get a great view of the complete skyline including the Flyer.
