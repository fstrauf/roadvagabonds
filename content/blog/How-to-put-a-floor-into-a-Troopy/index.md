To make your car a comfy home, start with the floor. It's pretty easy and even if you are not very skilled you can get the job done.<!-- end --> This is how we did it:

## Steps

1. take out all the old stuff, clean the floor and check for rust. You want to make sure to have everything properly sealed and treated before moving ahead. Seal all holes using SikaFlex and blind grommets.
2. Measure properly (measure twice, cut once :-))
3. Glue framing in between the bumps using non structural pine and liquid nails (read instructions on how to achieve best results)
4. Cut 12mm ply into shape and glue Formshield to it (heat and sound insulation available at Clark Rubber). We had to cut this into two pieces. When laying the ply onto the floor, take notes on where your frames are and draw lines onto your ply accordingly.
5. Screw ply and insulation to frames.
6. Lay self adhesive vinyl on top (read instructions)
