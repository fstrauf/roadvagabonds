Our one week trip to the Land of the rising sun was an absolutely stunning adventure into buzzling cities and majestic mountains.<!-- end -->

## Tokyo

With [ANA](https://www.ana.co.jp/en/us/) we arrived at Narita airport, 60 km outside of Tokyo. <!-- end -->There are different options to get into city center, depending on your budget and destination you can choose between bus, train or taxi.
 We took the fastest option, the [Keisei Skyliner](http://www.keisei.co.jp/keisei/tetudou/skyliner/us/ae_outline/index.php<) - for more information go to the Railway ticket center. Tokyo has a good public transport and everything is connected via MRT. Buy a top up Cosmo Card to make travelling with MRT easy and comfortable. You can top up at every station and even buy drinks and snacks at vending machines with it.

Tokyo is a modern and exciting city with lots of delicious food and an always busy vibe. Here are some things you can do during your stay:

*   Ginza - famous for shopping and entertainment, street closed on Saturdays, good Sushi place at Tokyu Plaza Ginza - [Sushi Hanamaru](http://www.sushi-hanamaru.com/la_en/index.html)
    
*   Tokyo Imperial Palace - take a walk through the large park
    
*   Edo Museum - learn more about the history of Tokyo in a vivid way
    
*   Asakusa - very touristic and crowded especially on weekends, but we found a nice hostel here - [Haru Hostel](http://hostel-haru.com/index.html)
    
*   Odaiba - get there via train across the famous Rainbow bridge and spend time at the beach and the Seaside Park
    
*   Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building - free observatory, check operation hours before you go there
    
*   Tokyo Tower
    
*   Akhibara; the technology district and there is a great and popular Ramen Bar close by - [Motenashi Kuroki](https://goo.gl/maps/SD2fAnS7xG32)
    
*   Shibuya with the must visit Shibuya crossing and a bustling shopping scene
    
*   Shinjuku with heaps of restaurants and again lot’s of shopping, if you plan to go hiking and don’t have all your gear yet, make sure to stop at [L-Breath Shinjuku Shop](https://goo.gl/maps/hBBKcivUDrk) - a 7 story hiking and outdoor store it has everything you will need

## Yokohma

From Tokyo you can take a 40 minutes MRT ride to the second largest city of Japan, Yokohama. We’ve been there in the evening and enjoyed a romantic and peaceful atmosphere. With an amazing city view we had a walk and a beer at the Ōsanbashi Pier - the oldest pier in Yokohama. After a bit of sightseeing, finish your day in the Noge district in one of the many bars and Izakaya. Izakaya is a classic Japanese bar where they serve delicious food - mostly little bites so you can try lots of different things and as always in Japan, the food is just great. Check your latest MRT back to Tokyo, the MRT runs until 12 am, after that you need to take a taxi which is quite expensive!

## Hiking - Day 1

After asking one of my husbands colleagues for tips to hike the [Omote Ginza Trail](http://www.azumino-e-tabi.net/hike/courses/courses_b.html) through the northern part of the Chūbu-Sangaku National Park also known as the Japanese alps, he kindly offered to join us on the trip as he loves hiking and this is one of his favorite hikes. It’s a 4 day trip included climbing Yarigatake the 5th highest peak of Japan at 3180 m, also known as Japan’s Matterhorn. We modified the track a little bit to make it back to Tokyo in time. The reservations of mountain huts is not really required, but you should book them in advance if possible so they can plan accordingly. Unfortunately it’s all Japanese so you can either ask someone familiar with the language or try and google-translate through their website and give them a call.

We met our Japanese friend, Taro at Shinjuku Express Bus Terminal and started our trip with a 4 ½ hour bus ride to Matsumoto. From Matsumoto we took a train to Hotaka, where another bus drove us all the way up to our first accommodation - Nakabusa Onsen at 1455 m altitude. Here we stayed in a simple Japanese style room which was a little bit cold, but you can warm yourself in one of the many Onsen (hot spring). We slept on a simple mattress on the floor. Dinner and breakfast was included and quite good.

## Hiking - Day 2

We started our first day hiking at 6:30 am - the departure time depends on the weather conditions, we had rain forecasted so decided to start early! The trail was a steep slope up the mountain, but there are rest areas everywhere, where you can have breakfast. The first big hut on the way is the Enzansou Mountain Hut. So, it’s a perfect place to have lunch - it takes around 3 ½ hours in total to get here and is already up at around 2500 m. After a break, the best part of the trail starts from here, you'll walk along a spectacular ridge with view on the northern Alps and the destination, Yarigatake.

At around 2 pm we arrived the Otensho Hutte hut at 2,650 m altitude and had our first night up in the mountains. Again we had a delicious dinner with a cold beer. The room was more comfortable as the first one and we had a more or less good night here.

## Hiking - Day 3

We got up at 4:30, had a powerful breakfast  and left the Otensho hut at 5:30. We started hiking with zero sight, but luckily, no rain - actually we were quite happy as the forecast was all rainy! The trail was steep with a bunch of ladders to climb up and down, passing through a valley from one ridge to another on our way to Yarigatake. We stopped only for a coffee which Taro prepared with his Jetboil and a snack at a hut. A rare sight that day was Yarigatake who only appeared occasionally when the fog cleared for a short while.

At 11:30 am we finally arrived at Yarigatake Sanso, the hut 100 m below the peak and were really happy to have our lunch and a beer. After a short nap we climbed up to the top of Yarigatake (3180 m) - with no sight at all. You will need 1 hour for the roundtrip. Try to avoid high traffic, it can be a little dangerous and will take more time, because you have to wait at the ladders.

We got another beer and had a classic Japanese Dinner at 5 pm. After dinner the sky suddenly cleared up and we got an amazing view on the Yarigatake, the surrounding alps and Mount Fuji while we watched the sun set.

## Hiking - Day 4

The next morning started early. We got up at 5 am to see a beautiful sunrise. After breakfast, at around 7 am we hiked all the way down through [Kamikochi](http://www.kamikochi.org/), a famous natural beauty scenery valley and part of the Chūbu-Sangaku National Park, to the [Tokusawa-en hut](http://www.tokusawaen.com/english.html). The hike is actually beautiful as you walk through a forest along the clear blue Azusa River. The last night was camping and we pre-booked a tent, while Taro brought his own - camping is optional, you can opt for a room inside the hut. After setting up tent we walked over to the river to find a spot to take a bath in the ice cold water. Which we definitely enjoyed our first bath after 3 days ;).

After a cozy night in our tent we walked 1 ½ hours to the national park entrance with the famous Kappa Bridge. There a plenty's of souvenir shops and restaurants where you can enjoy a good meal and cold beer. At 3 pm our luxury bus departed from the Kamikochi bus terminal back to Tokyo, where we arrived at 7:30 pm.

We loved the hike in the Japanese alps and were really glad Taro joined us on it. He sure helped us with the bookings and made asking for dinner and breakfast times, navigation and just reading signs a whole lot easier. Thanks a lot Taro, we will be back! The locals were friendly since we were the only western people and had learned a few Japanese words. The nature is truly amazing out here and since there are no roads or lifts up, it is a very special place one can only hike (or fly) up to.
