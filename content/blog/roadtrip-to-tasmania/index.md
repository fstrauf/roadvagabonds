Tasmania has been on the list since we moved to Australia. It just looks so different to the rest and it absolutely was an amazing destination to travel to.

It has a lot to offer from white beaches, to snowy peaks and wild rain forests. Here is what you should not miss

## Getting there

If your planning a roadtrip (expecially camping) and live in Australia you will probably want to take the ferry from Melbourne to Devonport. [The Spirit of Tasmania](https://www.spiritoftasmania.com.au/) takes roughly 10 hours and offers a night- and a daytime trip. They have cabins, a restaurants, two cinemas and a whole bunch of other stuff to keep you busy. [Our troopy]() with poptop and roofracks is higher than 2.1m, but you can just secure a spot for higher vehicles. You can of course fly in two one of Tassies airports and rent a car/camper.

## The east

The east coast looks a bit like New South Wales with white beaches, clear blue water and - at least when we were there - good weather.

Some free camping at waterhouse coservation area, nice spots just a bit windy.

Police man point is a great campground, quite small but right at a beautiful beach.

Bay of fires, obiously nice to see with really cool beaches, although I must say since we live in NSW it wasn't something completely stunning.

Great campground at Scamander forest at a quiet river.

One of my highlights was Ben Lomond national park. It's a long and empty ride and certainly not as busy as the Bay of Fires. It is a mountain plateau withing a skiing resort on top. The best part really is the Jacobs Ladder, a switchback dirt road up the mountain.

Wineglass bay Isthmus track was nice but not as spectacular as thought.

Tesselated Pavement and down to Port Arthur - 40$ entrance fee - it's really quite interesting and you can easily spend two days here but

Great campground at Fortescue bay - it's a gravel road and you don't need 4x4.

Eldee camp spot, clean showers, nioce spot close tpo Hobart.

## the west

Cockle creek nice empty spot to stay, just don't camp all the way through - it might be a bit busy.

Beautiful campsite at Mount Field north of Hobart. Really nice hike through the snow.

Tried Florentine Road as a shortcut up north but the last bridge was closed, so I had to go all the way back.

Camp at lake binney. Very nice, quiet, free spot.

Lake st. Clair and hike to mount Rufus, quite some snow patches and the weather changes quickly, so make sure to have proper gear.

Up to lake Burbury close to Queenstown was another empty lakeside spot.

Bird river track was an amazing drive, I felt like you don't actually need a 4x4 but it is very narrow and falling trees can limit height of the track.

Montezuma Falls; you can access it through the town down a little hiking track or take a 4x4 track in. The track is rated medium, but if it's been raining it can actually be quite challenging at times. It takes 2 hours one way and you will need to go back the same way. There is a track forking back to the main road but it's rated difficult with deep holes and river crossings impassible in heavy rain.

Lake Mcintosh, beautiful campsite at lake.

Cradle Mountain, absolutely recommend this - great hikes. I started from dove lake, took the alternative route (steeper but faster) up to Marions Lookout and then climbed up Cradle Mountain. The last bit was pretty steep and you will need to climb up - I actually couldn't make it all the way up because of deep snow fields on a steep slope section. Descent back down via face track along the lake. All in took me about 4-5 hours including two short breaks.

A good spot before heading back on the ferry in the morning was the Railton Seld Contained RV Park.

## tips for your trip

1. get the holiday national park ticket. A single pass costs 24 and the holiday one 60, so it's cheaper once you visit three parks.
2. In September a lot of campgrounds are still closed so you might want to call ahead of arrival.
3. We used Wikicamps, Maps.me, Google Maps and Waze - all have their own purpose - someone should really build a map to rule them all!
4. I only noticed this a few days / national parks into the trip, but you are not allowed to fly drones in national parks in tassie.



## When to go

Not quite sure. We did the trip in end September and it was still a bit cold but nice and empty wherever we camped. Not mozzies too.
