A must have for the Troopy is a fold down table attached to the backdoor.<!-- end --> This one comes with a slide-out extension underneath. It's real simple check out the steps below.

## Steps

1. take off the old cover carefully, so you can draw a copy on the new plywood (including holes).
2. cut out the new plywood back-piece from the 9mm ply.
3. widen existing holes to fit the rivnuts, place and tighten rivnuts
4. cut out the table-piece, the slide-out, the slide-frame and the hinge-fix from 12mm ply
5. screw hinge-fix to back-piece
6. fix back-piece to door using bolts and rivnuts (we used eye bolts on the top to fix the wire)
7. place the slide-out ontop of the table-piece to measure where to place the frame - screw down the frame (ensure it's not to tight so you can still slide the slide-out)
8. fix table-piece to hinge-fix using the hinge
9. fix eye screws to table-piece end and connect eye screws to eye bolt using wire.
10. connect all wires with swages to fix them around the eye bolts
