After living almost one year in one of the most expensive cities in the world, (this is [how we got here](https://roadvagabonds.com/2018-6-15-how-we-ended-up-in-singapore)) I would like to share our personal experience with the costs of a life in Singapore.<!-- end --> Of course all of this depends on your style of living, but it should give you a good overview.

## Singapore - Cost of Living (monthly)

## Housing

Rental prices depend on location and size of your apartment of course. We stayed in a small apartment in a new condo in Bugis. Even though the price was quite high, we did not regret to move there. The location was perfect; 20 minutes to walk along the F1 track to Marina Bay and CBD and 5 minutes to get there by MRT. With lots of bars and restaurants around, MRT access and supermarkets in the basement, it was very convenient.

As we were the first tenants in the apartment, it was in perfect condition with great  facilities - 50m lap pool, BBQ pit, another pool on the rooftop, 3 hot tubs and a small gym. You can definitely find cheaper options further outside it just all depends on your preferences. During our home search we viewed a lot of nice apartments with good facilities for a cheaper price.

Before signing the tenancy agreement always try and negotiate on the price. There is also a great website in Singapore that lets you compare rental prices for apartments in all condos - link. We saved $100 a month by doing so ;)

## Utilities

Before moving in, you have to sign up for an [SP Group](https://services.spservices.sg/#/openAccount) online account and follow the steps for your application (by now Singapore has opened up for a free market so you can as well compare different providers). Generally we did not use a lot of energy but just consider that you are living in the tropics and it therefore is quite hard to survive without aircon. We only used it at night and managed to keep our energy consumption low.

## Health Insurance

As a non citizen or non PR you’re not eligible to join the public health system in Singapore. You will need to take care of it yourself. Like everything in Singapore it can be really expensive if something happens to you and you’re not covered properly. There are plenty of international health insurance companies like [BUPA](https://www.bupa.com/), [Allianz](https://www.allianzworldwidecare.com/en/) or [Liberty Insurance](https://www.libertyinsurance.com.sg/) offering plans. Keep in mind that there could be waiting periods for some types of coverage like dental treatments, maternity, etc. In case you were covered by an international health insurance before and absolved the waiting period already, it’s worth talking to your new insurance to shorten the waiting period and get covered for specific treatments faster.

## Retirement

For retirement it’s the same, you’re not eligible to put money in the public retirement fond if you’re a non citizen or non PR. It’s important to find a way to save money for your retirement by yourself.

## Mobile & Broadband

The main mobile and broadband providers in Singapore are [Singtel](https://www.singtel.com/), [Starhub](https://www.starhub.com/personal.html) and [M1](https://www.m1.com.sg/home). Costs and range of plans are similar, sometimes they have promotions and special offers, just check out before deciding for one of them. We got Singtel for mobile and Starhub for broadband with contracts running for 1-2 years. To sign up for a postpaid mobile contract you have to be on an Employment Pass, if not you’re only able to get a prepaid SIM card.

## Eating & Bars

For us, cooking in Singapore would have been more expensive than eating out. Some reasons below:

1.  Buying good quality food is quite expensive and there are not a lot of shops around.
    
2.  If you want to cook like you did back home, finding European ingredients can be difficult and expensive as well.
    
3.  Many kitchens are not very well equipped and just come with a small stove top and no oven.
    
4.  Eating outside is cheap - if you want to go super cheap you can get a meal for less than $6 in a hawker center (quality is not the best), but there are also a lot of small restaurants with better quality where you can get a meal for $10-15
    
5.  Variety of food in Singapore is amazing - Thai, Japanese, Indian, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Korean
    

Going out for drinks in Singapore is super expensive but you get used to it ;) Check out our favorites [here](https://roadvagabonds.com/2019-01-04-Favorite-bars-in-Singapore).

## Groceries

Compared to countries who actually produce food themselves, Singapore is really expensive. We bought fruits and veggies for our morning smoothie at one of the many wet markets - variety and quality is often better than in the supermarket and it’s cheaper. We got all other groceries at [Giant](https://giant.sg/) , [FairPrice](https://www.fairprice.com.sg/) or [Cold Storage](https://coldstorage.com.sg/). Giant and Fairprice are cheaper but Cold Storage has more European / western options so most of the times we needed both. In Singapore there’s also a lot of online delivery services, [Redmart](https://redmart.com/) being one of them. We tried it once, but as they pack everything in a crazy amount of plastic bags we decided  to continue shopping in the stores. Redmart is still great to order coffee, beer and those kind of things as they deliver it right to your doorstep.

## Transportation

We loved the transportation system in Singapore. It’s easy, convenient and super cheap! [MRT](http://www.smrt.com.sg/) is always on time and departs frequently (we never waited more than 7 minutes). For buses you sometimes have to wait a little and they will take longer because of the traffic, especially during rush hour and heavy rain. You’re not able to apply for the adult monthly travel card as a non PR or non citizen, but prices are really low. In average we paid around $50 a month and the monthly travel card is $120. The only bad thing is that MRT only runs until midnight, so you’ll either have to take the bus which doesn’t run frequently after midnight or you take a Grab or cab. Both of them are really cheap compared to western countries.

## Travel

As we didn’t have a car in Singapore to drive to Malaysia and travel options are limited within Singapore, we’ve done a couple of weekend trips. For us, that was the best thing of living here because it’s a great location to explore South East Asia. We made the experience to book flights early enough will be cheaper than book a last minute flight as a lot of people living in Singapore are doing those short trips. So your expenses on travel depend on your travel engagement and booking time. We spent a lot more money for travel than back in Germany.
