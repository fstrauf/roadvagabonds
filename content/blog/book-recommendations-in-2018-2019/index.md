One of my daily routines is reading for at least 30 minutes after I get up every day. That's a minimum of 182 hours a year. On top comes the weekend, holidays and bus rides to work. Here is what I've been reading in the last year.<!-- end -->

This book caught my attention after reading about Patagonia on a blog. Until then, I thought it was another one of these outdoor companies, but the book really tells a great story of the founder Yvon Chouinard. He starts with simple climbing gear and slowly grows into a clothing brand. On his way he rethinks how a business should be run and how he can create great quality and sustainability. Check out their stores, they will repair your stuff and in his book he actually recommends only buying when you really need to and the old can't be repaired anymore.

**Lessons learned**
> Buy less and think about repairing instead of buying new.
