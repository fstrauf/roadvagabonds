One of my daily routines is reading for at least 30 minutes after I get up every day. That's a minimum of 182 hours a year. On top comes the weekend, holidays and bus rides to work. Here is what I've been reading in the last year.<!-- end -->

## Let my People go Surfing

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Let-People-Surfing-Education-Businessman/dp/B01KB9LY6I/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=let+my+people+go+surfing&qid=1564730837&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=li2&tag=roadvagabonds-20&linkId=feea8efed9f87d3c48a2e532e1515910&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01KB9LY6I&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B01KB9LY6I" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

This book caught my attention after reading about Patagonia on a blog. Until then, I thought it was another one of these outdoor companies, but the book really tells a great story of the founder Yvon Chouinard. He starts with simple climbing gear and slowly grows into a clothing brand. On his way he rethinks how a business should be run and how he can create great quality and sustainability. Check out their stores, they will repair your stuff and in his book he actually recommends only buying when you really need to and the old can't be repaired anymore.

**Lessons learned**
> Buy less and think about repairing instead of buying new.

## Vagabonding, an uncommon guide to the art of long term travel

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vagabonding-Uncommon-Guide-Long-Term-Travel/dp/B00GG0BRZA/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=vagabonding&qid=1564730927&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=li2&tag=roadvagabonds-20&linkId=3caac657c6c746771268d8f918b320f9&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00GG0BRZA&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B00GG0BRZA" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Recommended on the [Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/) as the book that Tim took on a trip which then led to writing The Four hour work week. The book explains a different perspective on travel, polar opposite to mainstream travel and really encourages you to travel, no matter if you have the budget to do so.

**Lessons learned**
> Make a plan and get out there.

## The four hour Work week

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/4-Hour-Work-Week-Escape-Anywhere/dp/B005940G2O/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=the+four+hour+workweek&qid=1564730960&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=li2&tag=roadvagabonds-20&linkId=3cc26e3a1694a76624ab4ec73029e5e4&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B005940G2O&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B005940G2O" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

This book got me thinking about a lot of things, a friend initially suggested reading it, which then also led me to become an avid listener of the [Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/). Reading the title you would think this is clickbait (readbait?) but it really has a lot of interesting content. Even if you don't start working for four hours a week, it explains concepts of how to focus on relevant things, set goals, routines and habits and of course how to start a business and work less.

**Lessons learned**
> To me this book is a great collection of different sources to tap into and that's what I really like about a book; I want to finish it with a whole bunch of topics I want to do research on and a list of books I want to read next.

## Principles

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Simon-Schuster-Audio-Principles-Life/dp/B074B2CZJG/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=principles&qid=1564731015&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=li2&tag=roadvagabonds-20&linkId=8d36b40f218d2093d501ef3a39d69708&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B074B2CZJG&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B074B2CZJG" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Ray Dalio is founder of Bridgewater and manages one of the largest hedge funds in the world. This book is not about finance, but about how Ray uses lessons he learned in his life to turn them into principles. These principles can be used by him and others when making decisions.

**Lessons learned**
> It helped me to think about my own principles and how I can more actively use them for decision making.

## The Box

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Box-Shipping-Container-Smaller-Economy/dp/B00I51PQZU/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=the+box&qid=1564731048&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=li2&tag=roadvagabonds-20&linkId=2978e6fe1d782af7582a531beb5e7a91&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00I51PQZU&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B00I51PQZU" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Since working on a few IT projects around ports I have gotten quite interested in the whole industry. This book tells the story of how it all started and how the idea of a shipping container changed the world. After all, the global economy we know today would not have been possible without it, but if you where asked how it all came together you certainly wouldn't think about a shipping container.

**Lessons learned**
> The importance of simple solutions.

## The shoe Dog 

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Memoir-Creator-Nike/dp/B01CRJA470/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=the+shoe+dog&qid=1564731101&s=audible&sr=1-1&linkCode=li2&tag=roadvagabonds-20&linkId=a98661ae01d3108c08d79adbb0693fbe&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01CRJA470&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=B01CRJA470" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

I really enjoy reading autobiographies. This one, written by the founder of Nike, Phil Knight himself, is really special. Phil tells his story in such a passionate, emotional way it makes you want to cry and laugh at the same time.

**Lessons learned**
> Even the biggest corporations start small and struggle on their way up and it's really not about the idea but about committing to it (there where a bunch of shoe brands already out there before he started).

## Tools of Titans

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tools-Titans-Billionaires-World-Class-Performers/dp/1328683788/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=roadvagabonds-20&linkId=59f46f7da07f459673223413aa9a7e8c&language=en_US" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1328683788&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=roadvagabonds-20&language=en_US&l=li2&o=1&a=1328683788" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

Another Tim Ferriss book I really enjoyed. It's a big book, but it's really meant to be read as a buffet - choose what you like. It consists of mainly interviews from his Podcast and the most relevant notes he took during the recording.

**Lessons learned**
> Loads of interesting habits, routines, self talks from successful people condensed into a single source ready for you to try yourself.
