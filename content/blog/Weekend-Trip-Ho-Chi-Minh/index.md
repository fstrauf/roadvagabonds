Jetstar offers really convenient evening flights on Friday and Sunday for a short weekend trip to Ho Chi Minh City. <!-- end -->After arriving at the airport Ho Chi Minh, get some money from the ATM to pay for a taxi, it’s better to have some small money, sometimes the drivers don’t accept the big notes. Outside, go all the way to the left side and take the Vinsun Taxi or Mai Linh Taxi, they are registered and don’t manipulate their taximeter. The Ride to the city will take about 30 minutes.

## The Hammock Hotel

I highly recommend [‘The Hammock Hotel’](http://thehammockhotel.com/) Ben Thanh in District 1. It’s a quite new hotel with modern interior. The rooms are nice and clean and the staff is friendly and supportive.

We especially liked the free mini bar and rooftop terrace. On our arrival we asked the front office where we could go for a beer and he just told us to take the elevator up to the top and enjoy a free beer up on the hotel rooftop bar. That's right; Snacks and drinks are for free up there, which is great! On the terrace you can enjoy the nice city view and relax in a beanbag or hammock. Breakfast is included, you can choose one drink and snack.

Location wise, it’s a good place to stay because the main attractions are in 30 minutes walking distance.

## Cafes & Restaurants - Recommendations

Cocochin Food Court

*   Our friend brought us to this place. It’s a local and nicely decorated food court over two floors. You can sit inside or outside on the balcony and the food and drinks are cheap and tasty.
    

Phúc Quang Chay

*   I’m neither vegan nor vegetarian, but this Vegan Restaurant is worth a visit. Great food and super friendly staff.
    

Banana’s Juice Shop

*   Close to Phúc Quang Chay you will find this smoothie shop, where you can choose between different combinations. According to some friends, the best Smoothies in the city. And actually they were really good!
    

Hong Hoa - Banh Mi

*   Right in front of the Hammock Hotel there’s a small street Banh Mi shop. Banh Mi is a famous vietnamese Baguette with different toppings. During breakfast in the hotel we figured that this shop was constantly visited by locals, passing by and fetching a few baguettes. This is usually a good indicator for good food - turned out we were right. Good stuff here.
    

The Cafe Apartment on Saigon’s Walking Street

*   An old building with lots of small cafes and restaurants inside - many with really nice interior and balconies to sit and watch what’s going on on Nguyen Hue Walking Street. Kind of hidden at first sight, but sure worth a visit.

## SPA - Massage

If you still have some spare time you might want to relax at a vietnamese massage. It’s quite cheap and you’ll feel like newborn afterwards ;) I had my massage at ‘moc - simply natural spa’. It was really soothing and the staff is friendly. Before and after your treatment you get served a tea and dry fruits.
