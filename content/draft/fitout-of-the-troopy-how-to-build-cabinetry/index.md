measure the size you want to build. this depends on the fridge, where you want to place it and the size of bed you require.

We chose this setup since we have a poptop, so in case you don't you certainly want us a lower height and some more space for the bed.

Split into 3 pieces.
1. bench & boxex
2. bed
3. kitchen

measure size of boxes and the floor layout. build the boxes outside and attach the lid.

attach the frame to lay bed plates upon.

build kitchen box.
we used a slideout fridge.
recycled benchtop
2 burner stove compartment

Building cabinetry

We changed plans multiple times and where happy it wasnt alread too late.
Measure chest: L200xW53xH40

Measure Kitchen: L189xW50

#### Step 6

> fix back-piece to door using bolts and rivnuts (we used eye bolts on the top to fix the wire)

#### Step 7

> place the slide-out ontop of the table-piece to measure where to place the frame - screw down the frame (ensure it's not to tight so you can still slide the slide-out)
