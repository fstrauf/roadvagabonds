While in the car, walking to work or pretty much any other activity, I love to listen to podcasts. It is an amazing format that brings up content that is often much more up to date than books and can be consumed anytime on demand.<!-- end -->

A few months ago I started meditating almost daily. If you'd asked me about this a few years ago, I would have thought your crazy - why would I get into this spiritual, chanting, bell ringing activity. I simply started using apps like Headspace and Waking Up, but since they are quite expensive I sort of stopped after the trial period. In this book Dan Harris perfectly describes his journey into meditation uncovering what it's really all about and that it absolutely does not require any chanting, bell ringing or things of that sort. It simply is a workout for the mind - the tool that filters everything we get in an out odf our brain. So while we spend hours in the gym working on our body, why not also work out the mind. I found it very useful and this book is a short, crisp look into what is really important.
