Now that we are expecting our first child, my wife recently brought up the dangers of 5G radiation to us humans and I wasn't sure if this was actually the case. I had listened to a podcast [Science Vs.](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/science-vs/j4h39x) on this topic recently and the conclusion was that there is no evidence of danger in the radiation.

I still wanted to check the facts instead of leaving it with this one source. Here is what I found:

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/science/5g-cellphones-wireless-cancer.html

* the anxiety around can be traced back to one scientist; [Dr. Bill P. Curry](https://web.archive.org/web/20180603033545/http:/www.emscitek.com/) who conducted a study reporting serious health hazard of radiation by microwave absorption in brain tissues.
* Dr. Curry's evaluation was based on the pure tissues and did not consider the fact that our human skin protects us (like it does with sun light).
* So far no scientific evidence could be delivered to prove 5G frequencies as harmful. In fact if one looks at the technology 5G runs on a higher frequency than previous technologies (the frequency closer to light and further away from sound). So if light - an even higher frequency - can't penetrate skin, walls, leaves why should 5G be capable of doing so. The setup of 5G in cities actually requires many different antennas to cover across all blocking buildings, walls, trees, cars etc.

* one of the articles cited by the Science Vs. podcast actually dive quite deep into the matter of biological effects of mmWave on the human body.
* They conclude that current and anticipated future frequencies do no harm to our eyes or skin, as the intensity and length of exposure will not create sufficient temperature to actually damage the above.
* A few fields need to be further investigated but prove no damage currently

* Good scientific explanation of how radiation and waves work
* The only harmful option for us is "Light gets absorbed and each photon is energetic enough to ionize one (or more) electrons. " The reason we wear suncreen when we get into the sun. 
* 5G is not more harmful than coffee, nickel,
