## Steps

#### Step 1; remove old oil

1. let it run for little bit - warm oil flows better.
2. drive it onto a tarp so you don't mess up the floor/street.
3. open the filler cap - where you'll fill in oil.
4. get a bucket big enough to hold all the oil (see above)
5. loosen the bolt and unscrew it by hand, hold the bucket close once it pours out.
6. let the oil run out.

#### Step 2; change oil filter

1. This can be hard to get off so you might need a tool (sca grip tool or filter cap)
2. get a cloth underneath it and unscrew slowly
3. make sure to turn it downside up first before lifting it out - this will spill less.
4. take out trying to catch as much as you can.
5. apply some oil on the rubber seals of the new filter, to get it off easier next time.
6. screw on the new filter hand-tight and then another 3/4.

#### Step 3; change fuel filter

1. This can be even harder than the oil filter - you probably need a grip tool.
2. undo the sensor cable first
3. unscrew the plastic cap underneath the filter first - this works best with a multi width plier.
4. unscrew the fuel filter and take it out, place a cloth underneath to catch the diesel.
5. replace it with the new filter (oil the seals), tighten it and attach the sensor cable.
6. unscrew the second fuel filter, this is a cartridge with a filter - you just replace the filter.
7. There's a nut underneath you loosen, replace the filter and screw it back on.
8. Now you need to get the air out of the filters and fill it with diesel.
9. pump the little black rubber knob until you can't press it down anymore.

#### Step 4; refill with new oil

1. by now, all oil should be gone. Some people pour in a little sip of fresh oil to wash out the old.
2. screw the bold underneath back in.
3. slowly pour in the new oil checking the dip stick as you go.
4. the filter will require some additional oil so fill it just over the high mark.
5. let it sit for a bit and see how full it is.
6. close the cap.

#### Step 5; Re-grease

#### Step 6; Tighten bolts radiator

## Shopping List

1. **Engine Oil**: Specs are as follows (according to the Owners Manual):
> Oil grade: API CF-4, CF, G-DLD-1, API CE, CD
> Viscosity (SAE): 20W-50, 15W-40, 10W-30
1. **Oil Filter**: my 1HZ needs a Ryco Z334 - the part number for the genuine part is:
2. **Fuel Filter 1**: my 1HZ needs a Ryco Z252X - the part number ...
