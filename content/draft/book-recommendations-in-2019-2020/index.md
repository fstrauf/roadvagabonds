It is interesting how often you get book recommendations if you listen closely, pay attention and take notes. I have a little todo list with all books I would like to read - it fills up faster than I can read...<!-- end -->

## 10% Happier

A few months ago I started meditating almost daily. If you'd asked me about this a few years ago, I would have thought your crazy - why would I get into this spiritual, chanting, bell ringing activity. I simply started using apps like Headspace and Waking Up, but since they are quite expensive I sort of stopped after the trial period. In this book Dan Harris perfectly describes his journey into meditation uncovering what it's really all about and that it absolutely does not require any chanting, bell ringing or things of that sort. It simply is a workout for the mind - the tool that filters everything we get in an out odf our brain. So while we spend hours in the gym working on our body, why not also work out the mind. I found it very useful and this book is a short, crisp look into what is really important.

## The Power of Habit

We all have these habits, some are good and some are not. Charles Duhigg explains with plenty of examples how habits can be changed by detecting the cues that trigger them, changing the bad routines that we execute once triggered and using the rewards towards turning them into a good habit. Great book to make you think about how all of this works in your own mind.

## Why we Sleep

What an amazing book. Matthew Walker a neuro-scientust / sleep-scientist explains everything important around sleep. It will have you prioritize sleep much higher and make you value this key body function the way it should. He goes into a good level of detail without drifting into scientific papers and explains why sleep is so important, how we can improve it and how society should change to value it more highly.

**Lessons learned**
sleep more and sleep well, this has a great impact on almost everything in your life.

## The courage to be disliked

These two gentlemen explain, in greek philosopher conversation style, the principles of Adlerian psychology. I had never heard about this topic but found the aspects very compelling. From the answers to freedom and happiness to the source of all problems, this book dives deep into psychology but in a practical way that is easy to understand and practice.

**Lessons learned**
Do not strive for recognition by others, have the courage to be disliked to achieve freedom.

## The alchemist

I do not usually read too much fiction, but this book is a great way to explain philosophy in a nice little story. It's a really easy read but has a whole bunch of very interesting topics to think about. I was able to reflect this story onto my own life in many different ways.

**Lessons learned**
“It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting.”
