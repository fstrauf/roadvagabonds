## Folder structure
> Favorites
> Numbering
> Names & Sorting
> Stuff I put on my Desktop
> use the apple specific folders: Document, Pictures, etc.

## Todo List
> second screen
> always open as this is my most important asset
> synced to phone via iCloud

## Password safe
> Lastpass

## Notifications
> I got great results by turning them off. Nothing is worse than distraction.

## Cloud Storage
> This is a must, but a must is also that you use only one at one time.
> Choose one and stick with it, you can always migrate somewhere else, but don't use two at the same time.

## Discipline
> The biggest piece is sticking to rules
1. download files into their folders
2. Use desktop only for certain things
3. whatever comes to mind, swipe left and write it into your todo list
4. don't store stuff at multiple locations. If images are stored in the cloud, keep this the main storage.
5. It might be slightly slower when saving stuff, but you will be much faster when searching for stuff (I certainly open stuff more than I do save)

## Converting HEC to jpg.
> I have a little Automator that helps converting the iPhone format to jpeg which is often required for web apps.

## Storing Images
> images are stored in the cloud, I use google so they are on google photos. My phone syncs them to that I can download them from there.
> For images I frequently use, I've got a temp folder that I pop them in but then remove.

## Linking spotify with phone
> Keep listening when switching devices.

## Airdrop
> make sure to configure this as it is great to send over images, videos etc. when your internet speed is to slow to sync to google drive (like it is here in Manly)

## Do I really need this?

## Chrome tab sync

## Other tools.
