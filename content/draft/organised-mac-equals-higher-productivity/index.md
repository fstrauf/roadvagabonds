I wouldn't really say I am particularly organised in terms of my computer / mac - I rather just expect that everyone else is as well. But then I come across people who's computer is an absolute mess. Just image how much time we spend in front of these machines so if you want to use them more productively, here's what really helps me.<!-- end -->

## Folder structure
#### Favorites; 
> Most operating systems do a pretty good job in preselecting important folder - but you can still change this to you needs.
> I use standard folders as much as I can, meaning I have all my documents that are not synced to the cloud in Documents and all local pictures in Pictures. I use Downloads only for temporary stuff and clean it up frequently.

#### Numbering;
> A numbering system for your folders helps you to sort them and identify them faster. Think about the topics you typically work on and create folders accordingly.
> Take some time to think about what you need, don't over-engineer this, start simple.

Here is how my documents folder looks like:

#### My Desktop
> Like a desk at work, it looks much more inviting and organized if there nothing on it. I just keep it like that.

## Todo List
> I use the Apple Reminder app as I don't need anything fancy, I just need it to be available anywhere, whenever a thought pops up.
> It is synced to my phone via iCloud, regardless of what you use, to be this is the most important feature.
> The reminder app is always open on my Mac. I create a second Desktop to the right of my usual screen where I place the reminder app in full-screen.
> So whenever I need to write something down, I simply swipe left with three fingers (this gesture opens the right screen).

## Password manager
> Lot's of people still write down their passwords on a little notepad or post-its and worst-case use the same password for every single login they have.
> Password managers are nor 100% safe, but nothing will ever be 100% safe unless you disconnect from the internet and move to a remote island.
> There are a bunch of [articles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/02/19/password-managers-have-security-flaw-you-should-still-use-one/?noredirect=on) out there and the summary pretty much is; it's better ro use one than not to - this will allow you to generate strong individual passwords.

## Notifications
> I got great results by turning them off. Nothing is worse than distraction when you trying to work.

## Cloud Storage
> This is a must, but a must is also to use only one at a time. You will be confused by where you stored data, have different tools reducing the performance/battery-life of your computer and will need to remember passwords / pay for multiple services.
> **Choose one and stick with it**, you can always migrate somewhere else, but don't use two at the same time. I use Google Drive.
> Important is also what and what not to sync.

1. don't: coding and development projects - npm will load lots of small files that will take ages. Code should be stored in Git.
2. don't: pictures, this is optional but most major cloud providers have their own image storage. Of course this is different you store RAW-files.
3. do: all documents, project related data

## Discipline
> The biggest thing about an organized computer is sticking to rules:

1. download files into their folders. That's what you've created them for.
2. It might take slightly longer to store files at the correct location, but you will be much faster when searching (I certainly open stuff more than I do save)
3. if you love using your desktop, put your folder structure there, but don't just dump stuff there.
4. whatever comes to mind, swipe left or right and write it into your todo list
5. don't store stuff at multiple locations. If images are stored in the cloud, keep this the main storage.

## Converting HEIC to JPG / JPEG.
> Kind of annoying copying an image from your iPhone, trying to upload it to see the tool doesn't accept Apples native HEIC format.
> I have a little Automator that helps converting the iPhone format to jpeg.

1. Open Automator, New Document, Choose Quick Action
2. Adjust top section as shown below
3. Search "Change type of images", drag it to the right (add copy finder item as asked by the popup)
4. Adjust setting as shown below
5. Save Automator and name it something like "Convert HEIC to JPEG"
6. Right click on a heic to see the context menu showing your Automator Quick Action.
7. It works for multiple files and will copy the converted files to pictures (or whatever you have selected above)

## Storing Images
> images are stored in the cloud, I use google so they are on google photos. My phone syncs them to that I can download them from there.
> For images I frequently use, I've got a temp folder that I pop them in but then remove.

## Linking spotify with phone
> Keep listening when switching devices.

## Airdrop
> make sure to configure this as it is great to send over images, videos etc. when your internet speed is to slow to sync to google drive (like it is here in Manly)

## Do I really need this?

## Chrome tab sync

## Other tools.
> Draw.IO
> Visual Studio Code
> Chrome
> Clocker
> Google Docs
