Mocking around with Jerrycans for too long, spilling them, taking up space inside etc. we decided to get a water tank that fits underneath our 78 series.<!-- end -->

---

They conveniently supply a pump so you can easily wire it up and have it connected, you will need to think through how to plumb it up and what your requirements are. We chose a flexible set up where we can fill the tank from a hose, gravity feed it but also pump water out of a jerry can. The normal mode is the pump pumping water out of the tank.

## Steps

#### Step 1; Fit the extension brackets

1. these go underneath the existing fuel tank bolts. They are long enough so will fit easily.
2. Do one at a time, so your fueltank won't come crashing down, we supported the tanks with jackstands just to make sure.

#### Step 2; Cover tank with foam

1. this will ensure the tank won't rub against the steel chassis frame, we used the remaining formshield from our floor (link post)


#### Step 3; Mount the tank brackets


#### Step 4; desk
