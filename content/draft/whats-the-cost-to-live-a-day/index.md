I've been thinking about the topic of what it actually costs to live one day. This initiated by reading about people like Bodensee Overlander or The Way Overland, who take a few years off to just travel the world. So I was wondering how much time I could actually take off with my current savings - or asking a different way, how much does a day of living cost?

# How much does a day of living cost?

Say we require an amount of $ 100 to live a day. With $ 100,000 we could take off 1,000 days - which is a couple of years already. What if you spin this even further;  how much capital do I need to invest in something like an index fund to live off the interest rate? Let's assume we need $ 100/day and an average interest of 4%.

$ 100 * 365 days = 36,500 $/year
$ 36,500 / 0.04 =  $ 912,500

So roughly $ 900K is required under the assumption we earn 4% interest per year and require only $ 100. It's a simple example, but it shows that such a saving plan does not have to be difficult and if one is willing to adjust their life accordingly it looks achievable.

Let's say you have a job that pays you $ 100K / year. With cheap living and frugal lifestyle you might be able to fork out 50% as savings.

$ 912,500 / $ 50,000 = 18.2 years

So if your start with 25 you might get to retirement by 43.

It's sure worth to tweak this a little based on your personal circumstances. Teaming up with a partner is certainly good as you will have two incomes and can share the expenses.

I guess the hardest part is a change in mindset, can you actually be so disciplined to live frugal instead of going out, buying fancy stuff and driving an expensive car?

## New Economics by Henry Thoreau

* He argues that excess possessions not only require excess labor to purchase them, but also oppress us spiritually with worry and constraint
* As people suppose they need to own things, this need forces them to devote all their time to labor, and the result is the loss of inner freedom
* How best to earn a living? How much time should I spend at it? How much do I need to live well and to be free? 
* the necessities of life: food, shelter, clothing and fuel

What Thoreau had a grasp of is one of the most important cornerstones in economics: opportunity cost. I’ll quote Ed’s Third Law of Economics for that: “Opportunity cost is what you could be doing if you weren’t doing what you’re doing.”

If you date the blonde on Friday night, the opportunity cost is that you can’t date the brunette. Opportunity costs are invisible–it’s what you can’t have because you chose something else.

Which has implications that are every bit as philosophical as economic. If you spend your life living like a human ant, crawling through life doing meaningless things year after year, working at jobs where you’re paid merely to breathe, only to arrive home to watch television, then you must face the opportunity cost, which is what you could have done if you went for an existence with more gusto. And, since you only live once, choosing the human ant approach may involve the ultimate opportunity cost: life without living.

# How much in savings do I need to live off the interest

You may have heard about the FIRE movement, and they in great detail focus on my above question. How can one become financially independent, meaning to live without having to work but just living of the interest rate that you get from your invested capital. There are a few considerations that makes this really, really attractive.

## The FIRE Movement

From one perspective, we do not have enough assets to be financially independent.

Alternatively, we have plenty of money to retire early, we just aren’t living in the right place.

Location is the key component to the financial independence equation. Because location determines cost of living, in terms of housing, transportation costs, food, and available services.

### FIRE

If you are happy with living a lower middle class lifestyle, then you would need between $800,000 – $1,600,000 in investable assets returning 2.5% – 5% a year to replicate the $40,000 in gross annual income. Of course if you’ve been investing in the bull market for the past 10 years, you’ve likely seen a higher return than 5%. But over the long run, it’s best to stay conservative since downturns do happen.

# Are there alternatives to retiring with 67?

I don't quite fancy the idea of working until I'm 67 just to retire and figure out my body is too old to do all the fun stuff I'd like to do now that I'm in my thirties. Not to mention all the bad things that can happen to you on your way to 67. So how could you combine the two extremes of FIRE but also retire not too late?

- THe goal of most people is to do this until they are 67(or any different number until you think you can retire) and then live the rest of they days up to 20-30 years without - working and just enjoying life.
- The problem I have with that is, that with 67 I will be quite old, my mind might not be as fit anymore and my body will be worn down by the years of working. So why is it still - that most people live that way?
- What are the alternatives?

## Mini retirements?

Tim Ferriss describes this in his book.

## Sabbaticals?

## Working from a nice location?

We currently live in Manly, NSW, Australia and this place is amazing. It's just the type of town you'd go on holiday to and a lot of people actually do. It has nice warm weather, the sea breeze, the ocean at your doorstep and all the convenience of good restaurants, shopping and public transport into the biggest Australian city. Before moving here, I thought how I would cope with the reduction of leave days from 32 in Germany to just 20 in Australia (and 20 is quite good here). The fact is with living in a location where other people dream of going on their holidays almost makes you have a little bit of holiday feeling every day - I will need to test how long this actually lasts and if people who have been living here ever since feel the same way.
