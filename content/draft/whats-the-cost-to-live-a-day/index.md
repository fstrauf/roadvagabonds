# New Economics by Henry Thoreau

* He argues that excess possessions not only require excess labor to purchase them, but also oppress us spiritually with worry and constraint
* As people suppose they need to own things, this need forces them to devote all their time to labor, and the result is the loss of inner freedom
* How best to earn a living? How much time should I spend at it? How much do I need to live well and to be free? 
* the necessities of life: food, shelter, clothing and fuel

What Thoreau had a grasp of is one of the most important cornerstones in economics: opportunity cost. I’ll quote Ed’s Third Law of Economics for that: “Opportunity cost is what you could be doing if you weren’t doing what you’re doing.”

If you date the blonde on Friday night, the opportunity cost is that you can’t date the brunette. Opportunity costs are invisible–it’s what you can’t have because you chose something else.

Which has implications that are every bit as philosophical as economic. If you spend your life living like a human ant, crawling through life doing meaningless things year after year, working at jobs where you’re paid merely to breathe, only to arrive home to watch television, then you must face the opportunity cost, which is what you could have done if you went for an existence with more gusto. And, since you only live once, choosing the human ant approach may involve the ultimate opportunity cost: life without living.

## High level idea

We work hard and put a lot of our time into earning money.

This money we then use to buy goods to a) survive b) improve our life/situation/lifestyle.

THe goal of most people is to do this until they are 67(or any different number until you think you can retire) and then live the rest of they days up to 20-30 years without working and just enjoying life.
The problem I have with that is, that with 67 I will be quite old, my mind might not be as fit anymore and my body will be worn down by the years of working. So why is it still that most people live that way?
What are the alternatives?
What if we just work as much to simply survive and use the rest of our time to enjoy life already at a much younger age?
