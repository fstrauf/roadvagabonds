with all the load of our fitout we needed a suspension upgrade

Here are the options we went through:

I've talked to ARB and they of course recommend a full suspension kit including shocks and springs (400kg) asking 3.2K.

Find your local springworks and get your springs reset. Get an extra leaf or two added if need be.

Sounds like it may need a GVM upgrade to be legal
