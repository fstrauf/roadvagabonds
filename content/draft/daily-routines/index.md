We get up at 0530 am. and run through a bunch of nearly automatic steps every day. This absolutely helps beating your inner voice telling you to do something else (like staying bed or brainlessly scrolling through social media). It's a great way to start your day with a sense of accomplishment.

These routines carry on during the day and this is what we do:

## Excercise, flex workout for roughly (15min)
I personally like [this 15 minute flex routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_xrDAtykMI). I simply follow along every morning. I wouldn't go too crazy on this as it will become easier for your head to try and skip it.

## Meditation (20min)
Never did I think I'd say this, but I absolutely love meditation and what it helps you to achieve. The key is; don't think of mediation as this spiritual bell ringing, mantra praying activity, think of it as a workout for your mind (the thing that filters all that goes into our brain).
A great way to get started is a guided meditation using an app such as Mindfulness, etc. If you don't want to pay subscription after your trial period, you can just set a timer on your phone and simply get going. The core of the activity is recognising when your mind has wandered off and then bringing it back to meditating.
I can absolutely recommend 10% happier written by Dan Harriss.

## Journaling (10min)
### 5MJ 
(slot in the morning and before I go to bed); the idea is to think/write positive about a day, thinking positive makes you happier.

Start in the morning:

**I am Grateful for:**
1. ... 
2. ...
3. ...

**What would make today great:**
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

**Daily practice:**
1. ...

Before going to bed I do:

**Amazing things that happened today:**
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

**How could I have made today even better?**
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...


### Daily 10

## Reading (30min)
I read for 30min.

So by the time i've completed this it's 0645 - pretty early still huh?

## Write one sentence a day
I love this. It sort of makes you feel like you don't have to do a lot but then you end up writing for 20-30min.

## Daily Email
I try to maximize the efficiency when working and that is only possible when reducing distractions. Besides turning off notifications, I try and don't check emails outside my scheduled times. If people really need me, they usually call me.

## One hour of hobbies
This can be video editing, coding on the blog, reading some more, working on the troopy etc.

# Bed time usually is around 2130
After reading Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker, I really take it serious to get 8 hours of sleep a night.
