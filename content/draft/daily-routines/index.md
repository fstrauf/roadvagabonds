Do you ever wonder why other people get more stuff done than you? Where all the 24 hours of your day went? Or what you actually got done within a day? Habits helped me to structure a bit of my day and turn certain activities into routines.

I get up at 0530 and run through a bunch of nearly automatic steps every day. Repeating these activities helps beating your inner voice telling you to do something else (like staying in bed or brainlessly scrolling through social media) because you simply get used to them. It's a great way to start your day with a sense of accomplishment and a good list of things already done.

## But first what are habits / routines / cues/ rewards?

[Charles Duhigg (The Power of Habit)](https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/) has the full explanation and while I highly recommend his book, there is a short version. According to him, a habit consists of

* a cue; that acts as the trigger of a routine (alarm clock at 0530)
* a routine; the activity you go through (a workout, meditation, journaling, etc .)
* a reward; seems obvious (this could be the coffee at the end or just the feeling of accomplishment) 

It's by any means easy to manipulate these, but of you manage to see it that way, you might be able to connect certain cues, routines and habits in a way it helps you.

Here is what I do:

## Excercise, flex workout for roughly (15min)
I personally like [this 15 minute flex routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_xrDAtykMI). I simply follow along every morning. I wouldn't go too crazy on this as it will become easier for your head to try and skip it.

## Meditation (20min)
Never did I think I'd say this, but I absolutely love meditation and what it helps you to achieve. The key is; don't think of mediation as this spiritual bell ringing, mantra praying activity, think of it as a workout for your mind (the thing that filters all that goes into our brain).
A great way to get started is a guided meditation using an app such as Mindfulness, etc. If you don't want to pay subscription after your trial period, you can just set a timer on your phone and simply get going. The core of the activity is recognising when your mind has wandered off and then bringing it back to meditating.
I can absolutely recommend 10% happier written by Dan Harriss.

## Journaling (10min)
### 5MJ 
(slot in the morning and before I go to bed); the idea is to think/write positive about a day, thinking positive makes you happier.

Start in the morning:

**I am Grateful for:**
1. ... 
2. ...
3. ...

**What would make today great:**
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

**Daily practice:**
1. ...

Before going to bed I do:

**Amazing things that happened today:**
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...

**How could I have made today even better?**
1. ...
2. ...
3. ...


### Daily 10

## Reading (30min)
I read for 30min.

So by the time i've completed this it's 0645 - pretty early still huh?

## Write one sentence a day
I love this. It sort of makes you feel like you don't have to do a lot but then you end up writing for 20-30min.

## Daily Email
I try to maximize the efficiency when working and that is only possible when reducing distractions. Besides turning off notifications, I try and don't check emails outside my scheduled times. If people really need me, they usually call me.

## One hour of hobbies
This can be video editing, coding on the blog, reading some more, working on the troopy etc.

# Bed time usually is around 2130
After reading Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker, I really take it serious to get 8 hours of sleep a night.
