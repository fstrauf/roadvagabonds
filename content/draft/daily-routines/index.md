We get up at 0530 am. and run through a bunch of nearly automatic steps every day. This absolutely helps beating your inner voice telling you to do something else. It's a great way to start your day with a sense of accomplishment.

These routines carry on during the day and this is what we do:

## Excercise, flex workout for roughly (15min)
I personally like [this 15 minute flex routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_xrDAtykMI). I simply follow along every morning. I wouldn't go too crazy on this as it will become easier for your head to try and skip it.

## Meditation (20min)
Never did I think I'd say this, but I absolutely love meditation and what it helps you to achieve. The key is; don't think of mediation as this spiritual bell ringing, mantra praying activity, think of it as a workout for your mind (the thing that filters all that goes into our brain).
A great way to get started is a guided meditation using an app such as Mindfulness, etc. If you don't want to pay subscription after your trial period, you can just set a timer on your phone and simply get going. The core of the activity is recognising when your mind has wandered off and then bringing it back to meditating.
I can absolutely recommend 10% happier written by Dan Harriss.

## Journaling (10min)
5MJ (slot in the morning and before I go to bed)
Daily 10

##Reading (30min)
I read for 30min.

So by the time i've completed this it's 0645 - pretty early still huh?

## Write one sentence a day
I love this. It sort of makes you feel like you don't have to do a lot but then you end up writing for 20-30min.

## Daily Email

## One hour of hobbies
This can be video editing, coding on the blog, reading some more, working on the troopy etc.

# Bed time usually is around 2130
