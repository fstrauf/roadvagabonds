Not only during my time in Singapore but also right now here in Australia, I see people staring at there phones wherever I look. While walking, sitting in the bus, in the car, on a bench in front of a beautiful beach, just everywhere. What drives me up the wall though is when you are having a conversation with someone, and all of a sudden a notification pops up on their display and instead of ignoring it, they pick up their phone and start answering - I mean what the fuck? We where just talking. Often this happens in the office where people come up to me, interrupt my work and then, a minute into our talk, start reading emails. What happened?

# Why are smartphonees / technology doing this to our brains?

The Tim Ferriss show made me aware of Tristan Harris in this [episopde](https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?i=1000450386427). Tristan, a design ethicist and founder of the [Center for Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com/), is one of the pioneers fighting not only smartphone- but the addiction to technology in general on a large scale.
A quote often used by him is:

> "The real problem of humanity is the following:
> we have paleolithic emotions;
> medieval institutions;
> and god-like technology"
- E. O. Wilson

In this intro to the Center for Humane Technology, he goes on to explain what the actual price of free social media and other free apps is:

> free social isolation - meaning we don't need to get out and talk to people anymore
> free downgrading of attention spans - through the massive distraction these apps bring

While he is correct with what he is saying, I am not convinced his speeches and his design models will get the big corporations to correct course, after all it's their businessmodel to keep us addicted. So I guess it's up to us.

# Raising ones awareness

If the above hasnt helped you, maybe this will...

it's habits again - recognize what are the triggers, cues and rewards (messages, likes, ...)



# Practical things you can do

## greyscale

The tonal change just might be enough to make the apps on your phone a little less enticing, and you’ll help save yourself from endless checking and scrolling. Imagine Instagram without the saturated colors, or dim snapchat videos getting even harder to see. Plenty of app icons themselves use color psychology to entice you to click on them—and when you take away the color spectrum, you might also be able to take away some of their siren call.

1. social media becomes less interesting
2. videos become less interesting
3. phone usage overall less attractive

## approaches i've taken: https://humanetech.com/resources/take-control/


1. screentime for social to 10min daily
2. turn off notification to you lockscreen from all app other than calendar.
3. remove badges from apps, so you don't get distracted by the fact that the amount of emails has changed.
4. turn off vibration
5. greyscale
6. no games
7. mindful awareness of how much time you spend looking at your phone, how much it distracts social interaction
8. check the stats in screentime.
9. go for a walk without phone
10. bedtime mode
11. leave your phone out of reach
12. eat without a screen
13. Side note: It took a bit of Googling to figure out how to get the Safari icon off my screen, but it is possible. It’s under Settings > Screen Time > Content and Privacy Restrictions > Allowed Apps.)
14. build certain routines; I only dive into social media after my workout, meditation and journaling.
15. have an alternative for being bored. Read a book, meditate, go for a walk.
16. [replace digital tools with physical ones](https://www.inc.com/yazin-akkawi/7-ways-to-curb-your-smartphone-addiction-right-now.html)

It works! As one Co.Design reader told me via Twitter, “It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.” - https://www.fastcompany.com/90296054/how-i-designed-the-distraction-out-of-my-phone-in-3-steps

I’ve spent years behaving as though my phone were surgically attached to my hand; it didn’t matter that there was nothing on my phone to check—checking my phone was like a muscle reflex.

How the Distraction-Free Phone Impacted My Business and Productivity
My business survived my scaling back on email. I didn’t think I’d be able to get by without constant access to email. But guess what? The world didn’t stop spinning when I didn’t answer every client email in 10 seconds or less. I still check my email often (usually about five or six times per day), but not being able to refresh my inbox on my phone has done wonders for my productivity.
My productivity shot through the roof. Part of my job as a writer is to, you know, write. And in order to do that, I need to be in the zone. I’ve been able to get a ton more done because I’m not constantly pulled away from my writing (and out of the zone) by some unnecessary distraction on my phone.
I went after new opportunities. I used to spend a lot of time mindlessly scrolling through my phone. After going distraction-free, I took that time back and spent a good chunk of it actively pitching new clients—which led to new assignments, connections, and opportunities.


How the Distraction-Free Phone Impacted My Life and Well-Being
I reexamined my relationship with technology more broadly. Once I realized how happy I was without social media on my phone, I decided to give it up altogether—and deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts completely (which has also been seriously life-changing!).
I’m more present with the people I love. My friends, family, and husband love me—but they’ve all, at one point or another, commented on my phone use. Since my distraction-free phone experiment, I feel like I’m more present, and my relationships feel stronger (my husband has pointed out how nice it is to see me without a mobile device attached to my hand 24/7).
I’m sleeping better. Blue light—like the light that radiates off electronic devices—can wreak havoc on your sleep. Since I’ve been on my phone less (and exposing myself to less blue light right before bed), I’ve been sleeping deeper, better, and longer—which makes me feel happier and more energetic throughout the day.
I spend more time on things I care about. I was wasting a lot of time doing nothing on my phone. Now I have more time and energy for...well, everything. I’m spending more time on my hobbies, my personal relationships, and my health.
