A must have for the Troopy is a fold down table attached to the backdoor.<!-- end -->

12mm plywood table
9mm ply back
If you donâ€™t want to drill into the door, use rivnuts. They are quite cheap and can be inserted into the door so you will have a thread. Make sure the rivnut actually fits into to the pre drilled holes - they should be just about 9.5mm wide. There are a bunch of videos on how to build your own rivnut tool for 3 dollars.
Slide out table can be built by placing a few layers of wood just on top of each other and then cutting a slide out just in shape.
Use hooks for the top mount so you can fix some wire rope to it. You will again need a tool to connect the swages but you might be lucky and find a mate who has something.
COnnect a third wire rope to the slide out and connect it using another hook.
To easily pull out the slide-out i used an old seatbelt and just drilled it onto the slide out.


## Steps

1. take off the old cover carefully, so you can draw a copy on the new plywood (including holes).
2. cut out the new plywood back-piece from the 9mm ply.
3. widen existing holes to fit the rivnuts, place and tighten rivnuts
4. fix back-piece to door using bolts and rivnuts (we used eye bolts on the top to fix the wire) 
5. cut out the table-piece, the slide-out and the slide-frame from 12mm ply
6. place the slide-out ontop of the table-piece to measure where to place the frame - screw down the frame (ensure it's not to tight so you can still slide the slide-out)
7. fix table-piece to back-piece using the hinge
8. fix eye screws to table-piece end and connect eye screws to eye bolt using wire.
9. connect all wires with swages to fix them around the eye bolts
