There is probably only one thing I dislike about the troopy and travelling in it. It's fuel consumption and therefore it's damage to the environment. It runs on about 12 liters of diesel on 100Km.

So the question I've asked myself; is there actually a better alternative to overlanding, four wheel driving and camping that does not harm our planet so badly? It's contradictory, you try to get out into nature, explore beautiful places and at the same time contribute to its destruction.

Could you do an overlanding trip and run completely on solar? How would such a trip look like and how would you need to transform your vehicle?

# solar panels

Say you had a bunch of [these](https://offroadliving.com.au/products/150w-allspark-flexible-solar-panel):

![solar panels troopy](./troopy-solar-panels.jpg)

> 1460mmx540mmx3mm in size producing 150W with 25.5V each.

Say you had 8 folded up that you could just unfold on arrival somewhere:

> 0.725 * 8 = 5.8m^2

Kind of like [these](https://smartflower.com/) but on the roof of a car:

## maximum output
8x150W=1200W=1.2kW - that would be the maximum output at perfect sun exposure.

with the voltage specs above that would be an hourly output of
1200W / 25.5V = 47A

to charge a 100Ah battery it would take roughly 2 hours

100Ah/47A=2.1h

This of course assumes maximum sunlight and no powerloss.

Let's say we have about 4 hours a day to charge batteries and we'll do that around noon.

1. hour 100%; 1.2kW * 100% = 1.2kWh
2. hour 75%; 1.2kW * 75% = 0.9kWh
3. hour 75%; 1.2kW * 75% = 0.9kWh
4. hour 50%; 1.2kW * 50% = 0.6kWh

Let's use an average: 0.9



Watt = Volt * Ampere

In case you forgot most of what you learned about electricity (like I did) then check [this](https://www.solarquotes.com.au/how-does-solar-power-work/how-much-power-do-i-need/)

If a battery is rated at 100 amp hours it should deliver 5 amps of power for 20 hours or 20 amps of power for 5 hours. [2](https://itechworld.com.au/blogs/learn/102204998-how-to-calculate-your-solar-power-requirements)

# electric engine - how much power do I need

Let's assume we run a similar system to these guys [here](https://www.tembo4x4-elv.com/Technical-Specs). 

They have a battery capacity of 28,4kWh and claim a range of 80km with this.

Our Solar setup delivers an average of 0.9 kWh using that to charge the 28.4 would take roughly 31 hours (of good sunlight).

More broadly, this means:

- 2.5km per hour of average charging.
- charging 4 hours a day gives us 10km / day.

Not a lot!

# troopy facts

consumption: 12l/100km, diesel

Engine: "The 1HZ Toyota Landcruiser 4.2 litre (4164 cc) diesel inline 6-cylinder 12-valve OHC (overhead camshaft) is of the IDI or indirect injection design, and delivers maximum power of 96 kW (129 hp) at 3800 rpm and maximum torque of 285 N⋅m (210 lbf⋅ft) at 2200 rpm."[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_HZ_engine)

I wasnt able to find any info on the weight but let's say 500-700kg?!

Kerb weight: 2300kg
