You put a lot of time and money into your Troopy and ideally you want to keep it and drive it for a while. Here is how we take care of rust, remove it and prevent it.<!-- end -->

## Procedures

#### Washing it frequently

> Take good measurements and draw up a rough set.
> We attached the side panels to the box and kitchen first before completing the bed.

#### Waxing the surface

> The side frames will hold the bed so they need to cover the complete length.
> Attach them to box and kitchen.

#### Underbody spray

> The bed is really simple, just cut two pieces of ply, that fit in between box and kitchen (one of them longer than the other will allow you to also use it as a table).
> We store the ply on the floor when we don't use the bed.

#### Rust repair

> The longer bed piece can slide under the kitchen frame.
> On the other side we used a piece of old seatbelt and attached it to the C-column with a bolt (a thread here already existed for the backseats)
> the seatbelt is fixed under the ply so it holds up the table.
