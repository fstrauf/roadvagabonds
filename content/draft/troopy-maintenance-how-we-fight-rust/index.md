You put a lot of time and money into your Troopy and ideally you want to keep it and drive it for a while. Here is how we take care of rust, remove it and prevent it.<!-- end -->

## Procedures

#### Washing it frequently

> With the ocean right next door, there is a decent amount of salty air bringing salt and moisture to your chassis. We wash the Troopy at least once a month at a self service car wash - using just water.
> If we been on the beach, I make sure to spend some extra time cleaning it underneath.

#### Waxing the surface

> This was recommended by a fellow Troopy driver, who uses this surface wax.
> Initially we did this three times in a row to apply a sort of base coat and then switched to once a quarter

#### Underbody spray

> The bed is really simple, just cut two pieces of ply, that fit in between box and kitchen (one of them longer than the other will allow you to also use it as a table).
> We store the ply on the floor when we don't use the bed.

#### Rust repair

> The longer bed piece can slide under the kitchen frame.
> On the other side we used a piece of old seatbelt and attached it to the C-column with a bolt (a thread here already existed for the backseats)
> the seatbelt is fixed under the ply so it holds up the table.
